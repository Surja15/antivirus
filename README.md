>> ANALYSIS <<

    Purpose: Section header — indicates the start of the core analysis results.

    Relevance: Helps visually separate the analysis report for readability.

--Entropy calculated using Shannon's Information Entropy formula--

    What it means: The entropy values reported are calculated using Shannon's entropy, a formula from information theory.

    How it's calculated:

        Counts frequency of each byte (0–255) in the file or section.

        For each byte, calculates probability pipi​.

        Entropy H=−∑pilog⁡2(pi)H=−∑pi​log2​(pi​) — sum of all bytes’ contributions.

    Why relevant: Indicates randomness/unpredictability in the data — helps detect compressed/encrypted or obfuscated content.

Entropy (Shannon): 6.34

    What it means: The overall entropy of the entire file's raw bytes is 6.34 on a scale of 0 to 8 bits per byte.

    Interpretation:

        0 means completely uniform (all bytes the same).

        8 means maximum randomness (each byte equally likely).

        6.34 is moderately high — suspiciously random, possibly packed or encrypted.

    Why relevant: Malware often compresses/encrypts itself to evade static detection, increasing entropy.

Number of Sections: 4

    What it means: The PE file contains 4 distinct sections (like .text, .data, .rdata, etc.).

    Why relevant: Section count is basic metadata; unusual numbers may indicate packing or tampering.

Suspicious Sections:

    What it means: Sections flagged because their entropy is high (>6.8), which could indicate packed or encrypted data.

    Why relevant: Packed or encrypted sections often hide malicious code.

- .text: Entropy=7.04

    What it means: The .text section (usually contains executable code) has entropy 7.04, which is quite high.

    Interpretation:

        This is unusual — .text is expected to have code with moderate entropy.

        High entropy here can mean the code is packed or encrypted — a red flag.

    Why relevant: Points to potentially obfuscated or malicious code.

Flagged Suspicious APIs: ['LoadLibraryA', 'GetProcAddress']

    What it means: The file imports these Windows API functions known for dynamic loading or code injection.

    Why relevant:

        LoadLibraryA loads DLLs at runtime, often abused by malware to inject code.

        GetProcAddress retrieves function addresses dynamically, common in obfuscated calls.

        Their presence increases suspicion about the file’s behavior.

Risk Score (0-100): 25

    What it means: A heuristic score summarizing risk, scaled from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk).

    How calculated:

        Starts at 0, adds points for:

            Overall entropy > 6.5 → +20 points

            Each suspicious section → +5 points

            Each flagged API → +10 points

        In this case:

            Entropy (6.34) → close but <6.5 → no points

            1 suspicious section → +5

            2 flagged APIs → +20

            Total = 25

    Why relevant: Helps prioritize files for deeper inspection or automated blocking.
